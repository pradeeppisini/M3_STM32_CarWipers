# Abstract:
* The Wiper speed control framework controls the functional speed of the wiper as per the downpour condition. It cleans raindrops or some other fluids off the vehicle's windscreen. The earlier framework required mannual wiper actuation, and the activity of raising the wiper was hard to make due. Subsequently, this strategy is proposed to resolve this issue. The's task will probably further develop maturing the auto frameworks by giving robotized transmission. A large portion of the vehicles have two wipers, one on the back window and other on the front glass. The wipers parts apparent from the vehicles are the elastic sharp edge, the wiper arm holding the cutting edge, a spring linkage, and portions of the wiper turns. the caution gear can produce the power expected to move the wipers as need might arise to move. Presently a days we have the computerized control wiper framework at whatever point we quit in the middle between the cycle it will consequently come to beginning position this is the new wiper framework behind the wiper arm. This proposed wiper framework's guideline is practically identical to those of other existing customary wipers.

# FEATURES:

1. It will lock the vehicle when the button is squeezed once
2. It will open the vehicle when the button is squeezed two times
3. It will wiper on and it moves clock wise bearing and when the button is squeezed threefold
4. It will wiper off and it moves hostile to clock wise heading and when the button is squeezed multiple times
5. It will wiper complete one cycle when the button is squeezed multiple times.

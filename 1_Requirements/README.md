# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
* STM32 CubeIDE
# COMPONENTS:
* STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER BOARD
# DESCRIPTION:
* The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family depends on the elite execution Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-digit RISC center working at a recurrence of up to 168 MHz. The Cortex-M4 center highlights a Floating point unit (FPU) single accuracy which upholds all Arm single-accuracy information handling guidelines and information types. It likewise carries out a full arrangement of DSP guidelines and a memory insurance unit (MPU) which improves application security. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family consolidates rapid implanted

# HISTORY:
* By 1917 John Oeishi shaped the Tri-Continental Corporation later to become Trico, probably the biggest maker of windshield wipers on the planet. the windshield wiper had arrived at large scale manufacturing stage! By the mid 1920s, the hand-wrenched wiper had been supplanted by a framework that utilizes motor vacuum to drive the system. Vacuum Wipers were perfect, then again, actually their speed would shift as per motor burden and speed. By the mid 60s vacuum wipers were supplanted by an electric drive, and during the 60s. teh irregular wiper was imagined (and was at first dismissed by Ford).

# FEATURES OF STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER:
* Up to 1 Mbyte of Flash memory.
* Up to 192+4 Kbytes of SRAM including 64-Kbyte of CCM (core coupled memory) data RAM.
* 512 bytes of OTP memory.
* Flexible static memory controller supporting Compact Flash, SRAM, PSRAM, NOR and NAND memories.

# AIM & OBJECTIVE:
* To avoid the accidents during rain conditions.
* To remove the raindrops, dust, oil or water from the windshield.

# RESEARCH:
* Application is investigated from different asset like from Google, Youtube and research papers and afterward created one application model that is Wiper Control System.

# 4W & H (WHO,WHAT,WHEN,WHERE,HOW):
* Accept that the car is the microcontroller. Assuming the button is hit, the main drove (red) will turn on, Clicking again the wiper will begin, and the subsequent drove (blue) will turn on for an ideal rate. On the off chance that the button is squeezed once more, the third driven (green) will turn on, and the wiper's speed will be expanded in contrast with the past one. The fourth press will turn on the fourth driven (orange), and the wiper speed will be expanded as per the past one. The microcontroller (vehicle) is switched off after the fifth snap.

# Utilizes:
# WHAT:
* The operational speed of a vehicle wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control mechanism based on rain conditions. To generate, the control system incorporates a rain sensor (30) that detects rain conditions. The amplitude of an analogue signal depends on the detected rain conditions.
# WHY:
* To keep the windscreen clean enough to give adequate view at all times. #WHEN The windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.
# WHO:
* Mark Anderson invented on 1902
